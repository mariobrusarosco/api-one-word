# One Word API

## A REST API made with express and Mongo DB

## Local Environment

This project is not using any local database storage.
When running it locally, you'll be pointed to a remote host (mongodb.com).

For now, we don't have security measures, so the credentials
are shared via .env file under the key of 'DB_CREDENTIALS'

## To access DB content

```
yarn prisma studio
```
